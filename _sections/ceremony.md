Our wedding ceremony will take place at [Zion United Church]({{- site.url -}}/location.html) in Frampton Cotterell, starting at 12 noon.

The ceremony will be followed by tea, coffee and nibbles at the church. If you would like to bring a cake or some biscuits to share, this would be greatly appreciated!
